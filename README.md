This MMO Bingo web application was created as an outreach and engagement tool for researchers. It provides an online way for teams and trainees to demonstrate and celebrate good data practices (e.g., "Write a README", "Publish your data in a repository") in an interactive bingo format. The app is pretty general-purpose though, so the same nuts and bolts can be used for workshops, onboarding, community events, or any setting where people want to mark and link evidence of completed tasks.

This repository contains the full app (Node + Express backend + static frontend). All user data (accounts, boards, winners) are stored in a single AES-GCM–encrypted JSON file on the host. Passwords are hashed with `bcrypt`. This causes some minor hurdles for local setup (see below), but is generally appropriate for small-scale deployments ( like workshops, departmental demos, or research-group use), but larger deployment will require some rethininking to scale the log-in credential storage. 

* Each completed bingo entry can be linked to live evidence (a DOI, repository record, README file, pull request, or project page). That way the wins can be audited by whoever needs to do that, and also serves as a cool way for folks to share their accomplishments. 
* Winners are recorded (one winner entry per account) and presented with a thumbnail of their board so evidence is discoverable. Also the links for the completed squares remain usable. 
* Minimal infrastructure and clear encryption: the data file is encrypted at rest using a server-side `SECRET_KEY`. This makes the app safe enough for outreach use without a full database stack.
* It is coded up so that changes to the phrases, board size, UI styling, etc. is prety easy to change.

# Contents

* `server.js` — Express server and API endpoints
* `lib/store.js` — small encrypted file-backed store (AES-256-GCM)
* `public/` — static frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)
* `data/` — (ignored) where `store.json.enc` is created by the app unless you set a custom path
* `scripts/` — optional maintenance scripts (e.g., dedupe winners)
* `package.json` — Node deps and start script

# Requirements

* Node.js 16+ (recommended: Node 18+)
* npm
* A host for deployment that supports a persistent filesystem for the encrypted data file (or a refactor to a DB/object store). Example hosts: Render (with persistent disk), a small VPS, Docker + volume, or local machine.

# Local setup

1. Clone the repo and install:

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <repo>
   npm install
   ```

2. Generate a strong `SECRET_KEY` (must be at least 32 characters). You can do this a couple of different ways:

   * Node:

     ```bash
     node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(48).toString('hex'))"
     ```
Or if you prefer:

   * OpenSSL:

     ```bash
     openssl rand -hex 48
     ```

   Copy the generated string; treat it as a secret.

3. Start the app with the `SECRET_KEY` set. For development you may set `STORE_FILE_PATH` to a local path (recommended to add `data/` to `.gitignore` so the encrypted file is never committed).

   macOS / Linux:

   ```bash
   export SECRET_KEY="paste-your-generated-key-here"
   export STORE_FILE_PATH="./data/store.json.enc"   # optional; defaults to ./data/store.json.enc
   npm start
   ```

   Windows PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   $env:SECRET_KEY = "paste-your-generated-key-here"
   $env:STORE_FILE_PATH = ".\data\store.json.enc"
   npm start
   ```

4. Open the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The first run will create `data/store.json.enc` encrypted with your `SECRET_KEY`.
